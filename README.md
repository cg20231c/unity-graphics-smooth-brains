# Unity Introduction

In this meeting we will be discussing about introduction to Unity and Unity basic scripting. Unity is a powerful and popular game development platform that allows you to create interactive 2D and 3D applications, including games, simulations, virtual reality experiences, and more. It's known for its versatility and user-friendly interface, large community support, and cross-platform capabilities. Its accessibility, combined with powerful 2D and 3D capabilities, makes it a top choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. 

## Getting started with Unity

1. **Download and Install Unity**: Visit the Unity website (https://unity.com) to download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor.

2. **Create a Unity ID**: You'll need a Unity ID to access Unity services and the Unity Asset Store.

3. **Create a Project**: In this session we will be using Unity 3D (core) project as starter. Follow this step to create a project:
	- Open Unity Hub Application
	- Click "New Project" button
	- Fill out the name and path of the project on your computer
	- Click "Create Project"

Unity's workspace consists of various panels and views. Here's an overview:

1. **Scene View**: This is where you design and arrange your game objects within a scene. You can move, rotate, and scale objects using the Scene View.

2. **Game View**: The Game View shows how your game will look and function in real-time. It's useful for testing and playing your game.

3. **Hierarchy**: The Hierarchy panel lists all the game objects in your scene. You can select and organize objects here.

4. **Inspector**: The Inspector panel displays details and properties of the selected game object or component. You can adjust settings and attach scripts here.

5. **Project**: The Project panel is where you manage your assets, including scripts, textures, models, and more. You can organize your project folders and assets here.

6. **Console**: The Console panel logs messages, errors, and warnings generated by your scripts. It's a crucial tool for debugging.

7. **Toolbar**: The Toolbar provides quick access to common tasks like running your game, saving your project, and more.

### How Unity works?

Unity operates on a component-based architecture, and understanding this basic structure is essential for creating games and interactive experiences:

1. **Game Objects**: Game objects are the fundamental building blocks of your Unity scenes. These objects can represent characters, items, scenery, cameras, lights, and more. Each game object is a container that holds components, which define its behavior and appearance.

2. **Components**: Components are individual units of functionality that can be attached to game objects. Unity provides a wide range of built-in components like colliders, rigidbodies, cameras, and lights, but you can also create custom components through scripting. Components define various aspects of a game object, such as its appearance, physics behavior, and interactivity.

3. **Scripts**: Unity commonly uses C# (or other supported languages like JavaScript or Boo) for scripting. Scripts allow you to add custom logic and behavior to your game objects. You can write scripts to control how a character moves, how enemies behave, how items are collected, and much more. The scripts can be attached to game objects as components.

4. **Scenes**: A scene is a container for your game objects. You can think of a scene as a level or a distinct part of your game. You can have multiple scenes in a Unity project, each representing different parts of your game. Scenes help organize and manage the complexity of larger games and interactive applications.
